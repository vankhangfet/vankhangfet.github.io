Imbalanced classes put “accuracy” out of business. This is a surprisingly common problem in machine learning (specifically in classification), occurring in datasets with a disproportionate ratio of observations in each class.

Standard accuracy no longer reliably measures performance, which makes model training much trickier.

Imbalanced classes appear in many domains, including:
